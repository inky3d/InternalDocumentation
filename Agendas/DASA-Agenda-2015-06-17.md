* Consider adding **Clinics** in 2016
  Clinics are aimed at new users of Drupal. Often with multiple tracks for
  developers, themers, and decision makers.

  Summits are smaller and for more advanced users / developers / community
  leaders.
* Events to build community, coordination and assets towards the plan to be able
